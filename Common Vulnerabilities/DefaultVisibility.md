<h1 align="center"><b>Default Visibility</b></h1> 

In Solidity, if you declare a state variable or function without explicitly specifying its visibility (i.e., `public`, `internal`, `private`, or `external`), it defaults to `internal` visibility. This default visibility can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in smart contracts, which are referred to as "**Default Visibility Bugs**".

Here's a more detailed explanation of default visibility bugs in Solidity:

1. **Default Visibility**:
   - In Solidity, if you do not specify the visibility of a state variable or function, it defaults to `internal` visibility.
   - `Internal` visibility means that the state variable or function is accessible within the contract and derived contracts but not from external contracts or accounts.

2. **Default Visibility Bugs**:
   - Default visibility bugs occur when developers unintentionally expose sensitive state variables or functions to external access by failing to specify the appropriate visibility modifier (`public`, `private`, `internal`, or `external`).
   - For example, if a state variable or function should only be accessed by the contract itself or its derived contracts but is unintentionally made accessible externally due to default visibility, it can lead to security vulnerabilities.

3. **Consequences of Default Visibility Bugs**:
   - Default visibility bugs can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including:
     - Unauthorized access: External contracts or accounts may access or manipulate sensitive state variables or functions that should only be accessed internally.
     - Data exposure: Sensitive data stored in the contract may be exposed to unauthorized parties, leading to privacy violations or data leaks.
     - Contract integrity: Unexpected external access to critical functions or state variables can compromise the integrity and security of the contract.

4. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Explicitly specify visibility: Always explicitly specify the visibility of state variables and functions to ensure clarity and prevent default visibility bugs.
   - Use `private` or `internal` where applicable: Mark state variables and functions as `private` or `internal` when they should only be accessed within the contract or its derived contracts.
   - Minimize external access: Limit external access to critical functions or state variables by marking them as `private` or `internal` whenever possible.

## Examples

In Solidity, if you declare a state variable or a function without specifying a visibility modifier, it defaults to internal visibility. This can lead to unintended consequences, especially if the intention was to make the variable or function publicly accessible. Let's look at an example to illustrate the default visibility bug:

1. **Default Visibility Bug Example**:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DefaultVisibilityBug {
    uint public defaultVariable = 42; // This variable is publicly accessible
    uint private internalVariable = 100; // This variable is only accessible within the contract

    function getValue() view returns(uint) {
        return internalVariable; // This function is publicly accessible due to default `internal` visibility
    }

    function setValue(uint _value) {
        internalVariable = _value; // This function is publicly accessible due to default `internal` visibility
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- In this contract, the `defaultVariable` is intended to be publicly accessible, so it's explicitly declared as `public`. This means that anyone can read its value.
- The `internalVariable`, however, is intended to be private and only accessible within the contract. However, due to a default visibility bug, it's also accessible from outside the contract because no visibility modifier is specified.
- Similarly, both the `getValue()` and `setValue()` functions are intended to be public methods. However, since no visibility modifier is specified, they default to internal visibility, making them accessible from outside the contract.

2. **Default Visibility Bug Example**:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DefaultVisibilityBug {
    uint public value; // This state variable is intended to be externally accessible

    function setValue(uint newValue) { // This function is intended to be externally accessible
        value = newValue;
    }

    function getValue() returns (uint) { // This function is intended to be externally accessible
        return value;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- In this example, the `value` state variable and both functions `setValue` and `getValue` are declared without an explicit visibility specifier.
- By default, these elements have internal visibility, meaning they can only be accessed within the contract.
- However, the intent is for `value` and both functions to be externally accessible, allowing other contracts or external accounts to interact with them.
- Omitting the visibility specifier results in a default visibility bug, as these elements are not accessible externally.

These examples highlight the importance of explicitly specifying visibility modifiers in Solidity contracts to ensure the intended accessibility of state variables and functions. By providing the correct visibility specifier (`public`, `internal`, `external`, or `private`), we can prevent default visibility bugs and ensure the correct behavior of their contracts.

>**Note**: The default visibility bug in Solidity occurs when developers omit the visibility specifier when declaring state variables or functions in a contract. In Solidity, state variables and functions without an explicit visibility specifier default to internal visibility, which means they are accessible within the current contract and derived contracts, but not externally. However, if developers intend for these state variables or functions to be externally accessible, omitting the visibility specifier results in a bug.

## Mitigation Steps

To mitigate the default visibility bug in the provided contract, we need to ensure that the visibility of state variables and functions is explicitly specified according to the intended accessibility. Here are the mitigation steps:

1. **Mitigation Default Visibility Bug**:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract FixedVisibilityBug {
    uint public defaultVariable = 42; // Explicitly specify 'public' visibility

    uint private internalVariable = 100; // Explicitly specify 'private' visibility

    function getValue() public view returns (uint) { // Explicitly specify 'public' visibility
        return internalVariable;
    }

    function setValue(uint _value) public { // Explicitly specify 'public' visibility
        internalVariable = _value;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The `defaultVariable` state variable is intended to be publicly accessible, so we explicitly specify `public` visibility.
- The `internalVariable` state variable is intended to be only accessible within the contract, so we explicitly specify `private` visibility.
- Both the `getValue` and `setValue` functions are intended to be publicly accessible, so we explicitly specify `public` visibility for them.
- By providing the correct visibility specifiers, we eliminate the default visibility bug and ensure the intended accessibility of state variables and functions.

2. **Mitigation Default Visibility Bug**:

   ```javascript
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract DefaultVisibilityBug {
       uint public value; // Explicitly specify public visibility for external access

       function setValue(uint newValue) public { // Explicitly specify public visibility
           value = newValue;
       }

       function getValue() public view returns (uint) { // Explicitly specify public visibility
           return value;
       }
   }
   ```

   Explanation:
   - Specify `public` visibility for state variables and functions intended to be externally accessible.
   - By explicitly specifying the `public` modifier, developers ensure that these elements can be accessed externally by other contracts or external accounts.
