<h2 align="center"><b>Understanding Solidity Common Vulnerabilities</b></h2>

Solidity is a powerful programming language used for developing smart contracts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. However, it's crucial to understand common vulnerabilities that could compromise the security and functionality of your smart contracts.

In this repository, we've compiled a comprehensive list of common vulnerabilities in Solidity along with explanations and examples to help you grasp these risks effectively. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with Solidity, this repository aims to provide valuable insights into writing secure and robust smart contracts. 

**Why Learn This?**

By learning these common vulnerabilities in Solidity, you'll gain a fundamental understanding of potential risks and how to mitigate them. Feel free to ask questions and discuss any doubts in the Discussions tab. If you spot any mistakes, let us know in the Discussions tab as well.

**Getting Started:**

To begin, browse through our list of vulnerabilities in the repository. Each vulnerability includes a detailed explanation, code examples, and recommendations for mitigation.

**Short Description about the bugs**:

1. **Reentrancy**: This vulnerability occurs when a contract calls back into an untrusted contract before completing its own state changes, allowing the untrusted contract to re-enter the original contract and potentially manipulate its state.
    
2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Solidity's arithmetic operations can lead to unexpected results if not properly handled, particularly when dealing with integers. An overflow or underflow can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or falls below the minimum value representable by the data type.

3. **Unchecked External Calls**: Failing to properly validate return values and handle errors when making external calls can lead to unexpected behavior, including loss of funds or contract compromise.

4. **Access Control Issues**: Contracts often have specific functions that should only be callable by certain addresses or roles. Failing to properly implement access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of contract state.

5. **Unchecked Low-Level Calls**: Solidity allows direct interaction with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) using low-level calls such as `call` and `delegatecall`. Failing to properly validate inputs and handle errors in these calls can lead to vulnerabilities like reentrancy.

6. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Contracts may be vulnerable to DoS attacks if they can be excessively consuming in terms of gas or resources, potentially causing the contract to become unusable or leading to unexpected behavior.

7. **Front-Running**: Front-running occurs when an attacker exploits the time delay between the submission of a transaction and its inclusion in a block to manipulate the order of transactions and gain an advantage, such as front-running trades.

8. **Uninitialized Storage Variables**: Solidity initializes storage variables to default values, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the contract assumes they are initially `zero`. Attackers may exploit this by setting uninitialized variables to non-zero values.

9. **Public Data Exposure**: Contracts may inadvertently expose sensitive data, such as private keys or user information, by storing it in public variables or emitting it in events without proper encryption or access controls.

10. **Timestamp Dependence**: Relying on `block.timestamp` for critical decisions can introduce vulnerabilities, as miners have some control over the timestamp of a block. Attackers may manipulate timestamps to exploit time-dependent functions.

11. **Block Gas Limit**: Contracts that rely on a specific gas limit for certain operations can become vulnerable if the gas limit changes. It's essential to design contracts to be resilient to changes in the gas environment to avoid unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

12. **Default Visibility**: Default visibility in Solidity refers to the visibility modifier applied to state variables and functions when no explicit visibility modifier is specified. By default, state variables are set to "`internal`" visibility, while functions are set to "`public`" visibility.
